//  There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball game, Class A seats cost
//  $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9. Write a program that asks how
//  many tickets for each class of seats were sold, then displays the amount of income generated
//  from ticket sales. Format your dollar amount in fixed-point notation, with two
//  decimal places of precision, and be sure the decimal is always displayed.
